  \Acknowledgments{
I feel grateful to have such a supportive family and community which enabled me to pursue this line of inquiry very early in life. Since childhood, I have always sketched down ideas and dreamed up products, and I was encouraged to follow these ideas through to completion. I had early exposure to technology, and started learning technical skills to build and ship real-world applications. Starting with my mother's art website in 8th grade, I've always been passionate about programming and design.
In high school, I imagined a marketplace for student labor which I then built and launched. It was my first digital marketplace, and I learned a tremendous amount from this experience. In many ways, support from my family and community on my first digital marketplace empowered me to pursue this field more seriously. Thank you to everyone who helped me along the way.

  \Abstract{
    Commodified Digital Marketplace presents an economic theory for digital marketplaces where the good or service is commodified across suppliers. In these types of markets, buyers and sellers of the good or service congregate on the digital platform for value exchange. This theory models out the incentives across market participants, and ultimately derives a reductionist formula for marketplace profit and an optimal choice for the type of supplier growth to pursue. This theory  sheds light on how certain markets are better and worse positioned for digitization, and it highlights the economics trade-offs that digital marketplaces make across different stages. This paper also evaluates digital marketplaces more practically, and presents some real-world cases and strategies adjacent to this model and field of inquiry.
